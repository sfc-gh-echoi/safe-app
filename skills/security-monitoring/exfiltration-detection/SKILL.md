# Exfiltration Detection

Analyze Snowflake activity for potential data exfiltration patterns.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Select Detection Scope

**Ask user:**
```
What timeframe should I analyze?
1. Last 24 hours
2. Last 7 days
3. Last 30 days
4. Custom date range
```

**⚠️ STOP**: Wait for user response.

### Step 2: Run Detection Queries

Execute these queries against `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` to identify exfiltration indicators:

#### 2a: UNLOAD Operations (Data Export to Stages/External Locations)

```sql
SELECT
    query_id,
    user_name,
    role_name,
    query_type,
    query_text,
    rows_produced,
    bytes_scanned,
    start_time,
    end_time,
    execution_status
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE query_type = 'UNLOAD'
  AND start_time >= DATEADD('day', -{{DAYS}}, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
  AND NOT is_client_generated_statement
ORDER BY bytes_scanned DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

#### 2b: COPY INTO with External URLs or User Stages

    WHEN STARTSWITH(r.client_app, 'streamlit:Snow') THEN true
    WHEN r.client_app IN (
        'cortex_code_desktop', 'CORTEX_CODE', 'cortex_code_cli', 'COCO_CLI',
        'streamlit', 'SNOWFLAKE_CLI', 'SnowSQL', 'spcs_system_connection',

WHERE TRUE
  AND is_new_app
  AND NOT is_snowflake_app
ORDER BY first_seen DESC, unique_sessions DESC
LIMIT 1000
;
```

Note that new client applications against a user indicates new, potentially unusual behavior but it does not imply data exfiltration attempts.
Inspecting query history from suspicious client apps will provide more context to the account administrators.

### Step 3: Analyze Results

For each finding, evaluate:

| Risk Factor | High Risk Indicator |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Volume | Bytes scanned > 1GB or rows > 1M |
| Destination | External cloud URLs (s3://, azure://, gcs://) |
| User stage | @~ prefix (user's personal stage) |
| Timing | Outside business hours or weekends |
| User | Service accounts or inactive users |
| Frequency | Multiple exports in short timeframe |
| Sharing | New shares to unknown accounts |
| Sharing | Shares with broad object grants |
| Listing | New marketplace listings |
| UI Download | Large result sets (>10K rows) from SELECT |
| UI Download | RESULT_SCAN usage to re-fetch results |
| **Apps/Integrations** | **New OAuth integrations created** |
| **Apps/Integrations** | **Security integrations modified (SCIM/SAML)** |
| **Apps/Integrations** | **External functions with API access** |
| **Apps/Integrations** | **Native apps installed from unknown sources** |
| **Apps/Integrations** | **External access integrations (network egress)** |
| **Apps/Integrations** | **Grants to applications on sensitive data** |
| **Apps/Integrations** | **New Client Applications Used by a User** |
| **Replication** | **Replication enabled to external accounts** |
| **External Tables** | **External tables pointing to unknown storage** |
| **External Tables** | **Iceberg tables with external catalog/volume** |
| **External Tables** | **New external volumes (S3/Azure/GCS)** |
| **External Tables** | **Catalog integrations (Glue, Unity, etc.)** |

### Step 4: Present Findings

**⚠️ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT**: Present summary before recommendations.

Format results as:

```
## Exfiltration Detection Summary

**Timeframe**: [date range]
**Total suspicious events**: [count]

### High-Risk Findings
[List events with high-risk indicators]

### Medium-Risk Findings
[List events with some risk indicators]

### Users with Multiple Export Events
[Aggregate by user_name]
```

### Step 5: Recommend Actions

Based on findings, suggest:
- Users to investigate further
- Stages to audit or remove
- Network policies to implement
- Access grants to revoke
- Shares to review or drop
- Listings to unpublish
- **Integrations to disable or audit**
- **Review queries from new client applications observed against users**
- **Applications to review permissions or remove**
- **External functions to restrict or drop**
- **Replication configurations to review**
- **External tables pointing to suspicious storage locations**
- **Iceberg tables with unauthorized external volumes**
- **Catalog integrations to audit or remove**

**⚠️ STOP**: Wait for user to decide on next steps.

## Stopping Points

- ✋ Step 1: After scope selection
- ✋ Step 4: After presenting findings
- ✋ Step 5: After recommendations

## Output

Summary report of potential exfiltration activity with risk-ranked findings and remediation recommendations.

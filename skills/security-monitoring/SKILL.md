# Security Monitoring

Comprehensive security monitoring and threat detection for Snowflake environments.

## Overview

This skill provides a unified entry point for security investigations, routing to specialized sub-skills based on the detection type needed.

### Sub-Skills

| Sub-Skill | Purpose | Load When |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `login-ip-anomaly/SKILL.md` | Login anomalies, IP analysis, brute force, impossible travel | Authentication issues, suspicious logins |
| `exfiltration-detection/SKILL.md` | Data exports, sharing, external transfers, app integrations | Data theft investigation, bulk export alerts |
| `privilege-escalation/SKILL.md` | Role grants, user changes, RBAC violations, self-grants | Unauthorized access, privilege abuse |

### Threat Coverage

| Threat Category | Sub-Skill | Key Detections |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Credential Attacks** | login-ip-anomaly | Brute force, credential stuffing, impossible travel |
| **Account Takeover** | login-ip-anomaly | New IPs, rapid IP changes, failed logins |
| **Data Theft** | exfiltration-detection | UNLOAD, COPY, GET, presigned URLs, large downloads |
| **Unauthorized Sharing** | exfiltration-detection | CREATE SHARE, listings, external accounts |
| **Supply Chain Risk** | exfiltration-detection | OAuth apps, native apps, external functions |
| **Privilege Abuse** | privilege-escalation | ACCOUNTADMIN grants, self-grants, ownership transfers |
| **Insider Threat** | privilege-escalation | New users, backdoor accounts, service accounts |
| **Persistence** | privilege-escalation | Role creation, user creation, ADMIN OPTION grants |

### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic | Technique | Sub-Skill | Detection |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Initial Access | Valid Accounts (T1078) | login-ip-anomaly | New IP, failed logins |
| Persistence | Create Account (T1136) | privilege-escalation | CREATE USER |
| Persistence | Account Manipulation (T1098) | privilege-escalation | ALTER USER, role grants |
| Privilege Escalation | Valid Accounts (T1078.004) | privilege-escalation | ACCOUNTADMIN grants |
| Defense Evasion | Indicator Removal (T1070) | privilege-escalation | DROP USER/ROLE |
| Collection | Data from Cloud Storage (T1530) | exfiltration-detection | Stage access, GET commands |
| Exfiltration | Transfer to Cloud Account (T1537) | exfiltration-detection | COPY to S3/Azure/GCS |
| Exfiltration | Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567) | exfiltration-detection | External functions, APIs |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Investigation Type

**Ask user:**
```
What type of security investigation do you need?
1. Login & Authentication Anomalies (suspicious logins, brute force, impossible travel)
2. Data Exfiltration Detection (bulk exports, sharing, external transfers)
3. Privilege Escalation (role grants, user changes, RBAC violations)
4. Full Security Scan (run all detections)
```

**⚠️ STOP**: Wait for user response.

### Step 2: Load Appropriate Sub-Skill

Based on user selection:

| Selection | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Login & Authentication | Load `login-ip-anomaly/SKILL.md` |
| Data Exfiltration | Load `exfiltration-detection/SKILL.md` |
| Privilege Escalation | Load `privilege-escalation/SKILL.md` |
| Full Security Scan | Run all three sub-skills sequentially |

### Step 3: Execute Sub-Skill Workflow

Follow the loaded sub-skill's workflow:
1. Select timeframe
2. Run detection queries
3. Analyze results
4. Present findings
5. Recommend actions

---

## Full Security Scan

When running a full scan, execute in this order:

### Phase 1: Privilege Escalation
Load `privilege-escalation/SKILL.md` and run:
- User/role creation detection
- Privileged role grants (ACCOUNTADMIN, SECURITYADMIN, etc.)
- Self-grants detection
- Current state audit

### Phase 2: Login Anomalies
Load `login-ip-anomaly/SKILL.md` and run:
- IP baseline analysis
- New IP detection
- Rapid IP change detection
- Brute force detection
- Failed login analysis

### Phase 3: Data Exfiltration
Load `exfiltration-detection/SKILL.md` and run:
- UNLOAD/COPY operations
- Stage and GET commands
- Data sharing activity
- Application/integration changes
- External table analysis

## Quick Assessment Queries

For a rapid security check without loading sub-skills:

### Critical Security Indicators

```sql
-- 1. ACCOUNTADMIN grants in last 7 days
SELECT user_name, LEFT(query_text, 200), start_time
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE LOWER(query_text) LIKE '%grant%accountadmin%'
  AND query_type = 'GRANT'
  AND start_time >= DATEADD('day', -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
  AND execution_status = 'SUCCESS'
ORDER BY start_time DESC;

-- 2. Failed logins from brute force IPs
SELECT client_ip, COUNT(*) as failures
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.LOGIN_HISTORY
WHERE is_success = 'NO'
  AND event_timestamp >= DATEADD('day', -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY client_ip
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
ORDER BY failures DESC;

-- 3. Large data exports
SELECT user_name, query_type, bytes_scanned, rows_produced, start_time
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE query_type IN ('UNLOAD', 'COPY')
  AND bytes_scanned > 1000000000  -- 1GB
  AND start_time >= DATEADD('day', -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
ORDER BY bytes_scanned DESC;

-- 4. New users created
SELECT user_name as created_by, LEFT(query_text, 150), start_time
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE query_type = 'CREATE_USER'
  AND start_time >= DATEADD('day', -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
  AND execution_status = 'SUCCESS';

-- 5. New integrations/applications
SELECT user_name, query_type, LEFT(query_text, 150), start_time
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE query_type IN ('CREATE_INTEGRATION', 'ALTER_INTEGRATION')
  AND start_time >= DATEADD('day', -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
  AND execution_status = 'SUCCESS';
```
